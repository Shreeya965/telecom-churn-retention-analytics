📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Optimization
🚀 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end churn prediction system that not only predicts customer churn but also quantifies financial impact and optimizes retention strategy.

Unlike basic churn models focused only on accuracy, this project integrates:

Machine Learning

Business Cost Simulation

Threshold Optimization

Risk Segmentation

Power BI Executive Dashboard

🎯 Business Objective

Customer churn significantly impacts recurring revenue.

This project aims to:

Predict customers likely to churn

Estimate revenue at risk

Optimize intervention thresholds

Simulate ROI of retention campaigns

📂 Dataset

Telco Customer Churn Dataset

7,043 customers

21 features

Target variable: Churn

Includes:

Demographics

Subscription details

Billing information

Contract type

Service usage

🧠 Machine Learning Approach
Model Used

Logistic Regression

Chosen for:

Interpretability

Probability output for risk scoring

Business explainability using odds ratios

📊 Model Evaluation

Accuracy: ~78–80%

Strong recall for churn class

Optimized threshold reduces financial loss

💰 Financial Optimization

Default threshold cost: £93,850

Optimized threshold cost: £64,000

💡 Cost Reduction Achieved: £29,850

This demonstrates the importance of aligning model decisions with business cost.

🎯 Risk Segmentation

Customers classified into:

Low Risk (~10% churn rate)

Medium Risk (~43% churn rate)

High Risk (~70% churn rate)

Enables targeted retention strategy.

📊 Power BI Dashboard

Integrated scoring output into Power BI to provide:

Executive KPIs

Revenue at risk

Threshold simulation slider

Net benefit analysis

High-risk customer list

🛠 Tech Stack

📈 Key Learnings

Accuracy alone is not sufficient in churn prediction

Cost-sensitive threshold tuning significantly improves business impact

Risk segmentation enhances decision-making

Data science must align with financial outcomes# telecom-churn-retention-analytics
